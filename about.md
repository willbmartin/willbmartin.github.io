### Education
I am a senior at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am majoring in psychology and minoring in human-computer interaction. I graduate in December 2019!

### Work
I am a huge video game nerd. I am currently a games production intern at Adult Swim, and was previously a quality assurance co-op at Cartoon Network.

### Research
I am interested in educational technology, human-computer interaction, games, and how they all intersect. I am currently an undergraduate research assistant at the [Expressive Machinery Lab,](https://expressivemachinery.gatech.edu/) where I just helped publish a paper. (Woo!)
