For a class this semester, Psychology of Creativity and Art, I created a prototype for a drawing application. Below, you will see a few squares. Drawing (with your mouse) or typing in the red square, and then clicking in the white space area above the boxes will allow you to *stamp* the image you made in the red box.

 - The active box that you are stamping from or drawing in is denoted by being red, and can be selected by using the right and left arrow keys.
 - The up and down arrow keys will change the grid size you are working with (denoted by the number on the screen), making your stamps larger or smaller.
 - Lastly, you can erase your stamp square and start over by selecting it with the arrow keys, then pressing backspace!

I thought this would be a good final project for the class, because after talking for a whole semester on how people are creative, we didn't really talk about how the tools they use can help or hinder their creativity. This tool gives a certain scructure both the final image, and to the artists process, limiting them in a way that other drawing applications may now. 

In making it, I took inspiration from playing with stamps and temporary tattoos as a kid, and from making collages in art class.
