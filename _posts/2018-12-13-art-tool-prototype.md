For a class this semester, *Psychology of Creativity and Art*, I created a prototype for a drawing application. At the bottom of the page, you will see a few squares. 

- Drawing (with your mouse) or typing in the red square, and then clicking in the white-space area above the boxes will allow you to *stamp* the image you made in the red box.
- The active box that you are stamping from or drawing in is denoted by being red, and can be selected by using the right and left arrow keys.
- The up and down arrow keys will change the grid size you are working with (denoted by the number on the screen), making your stamps larger or smaller.
- Lastly, you can erase your stamp square and start over by selecting it with the arrow keys, then pressing backspace!

I thought this would be a good final project for the class, because after talking for a whole semester on how people are creative, we didn't really talk about how the tools they use can help or hinder their creativity. This tool gives a certain scructure both the final image, and to the artist's process, limiting them in a way that other drawing applications may not. 

In making it, I took inspiration from playing with stamps and temporary tattoos as a kid, and from making collages in art class.
