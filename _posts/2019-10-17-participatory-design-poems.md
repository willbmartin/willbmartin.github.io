### Participatory Design

I'm taking a class this semester on research methods in human-computer interaction. Today, I was tasked with preparing a **participatory design** activity for other students taking the class.

The Routledge International Handbook of Participatory Design defines PD as *a process of investigating, understanding, reflecting upon, establishing, developing, and supporting mutual learning between multiple participants in collective ‘reflection-in-action’.*[^1]

Personally, I like to think of PD as those fun in-class activites from elementary and middle school  mashed together with juicy qualitative research. They are fun. They are expressive. They are generative. And, importantly, they are informative. 

### Activity

Okay, first, let's define our problem space. For the sake of my class assignment, this was given to us: **designing better eating experiences on campus.**

From here, I broke the scenario down into a few key questions:

1. What leads to good eating experiences?
2. What leads to bad experiences?
3. What do people remember?

To answer these questions, I asked my PD participants to write poetry. Each of the above questions were turned into a poetry prompt:

1. What leads to good eating experiences? → *Meal of my Dreams*
2. What leads to bad experiences? → *Meal of my Nightmares*
3. What do people remember? → *Meal of my Memories*

To start the activity, participants were split into groups of three. Each member of the group was given a sheet of paper with one of the three prompts at the top. Participants were then asked to interpret their individual prompt, and write the first line of a haiku in response. 

Afterwards, participants rotated their prompt papers within the group and wrote the second line of the haiku. This was repeated again for the final line of the haiku, and the papers were returned to the original owners. 

Lastly, each member was asked to give a spoken word performance of the final product. As you can imagine, these turned out quite silly...

### Results

**Prompt 1: Meal of my Dreams**  
*Sweet and Savory  
The biscuits are almost done  
crunchy chicken skin*

**Prompt 2: Meal of my Nightmares**  
*Undercooked Chicken  
Strawberries, blueberries, all berries  
Wriggling Squid Legs*

**Prompt 3: Meal of my Memories**  
*I love Beijing Beef  
Handmade bread goes well with milk  
microwave pizza*
