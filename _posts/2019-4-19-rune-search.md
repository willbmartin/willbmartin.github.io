This past Spring semester, I was the project lead for a small team of undergrads at Georgia Tech, all apart of the campus game maker group, [VGDev.](http://vgdev.org) (Which is an amazing organization! Check them out if you are on campus.)

The game started as a simple pitch to the group: how can a word search be transformed by adding traditional video game mechanics and features? This ended up including things like a player character, movement, combat, dialogue, etc.

The game was built using Typescript, [P5.js](https://p5js.org/), and good ole HTML and CSS, with the goal of serving as an intro to webdev for my team.

Play the game online [here.](https://willbmartin.github.io/rune-search/) (Sound on for a lovely soundtrack.)
